**Effective Date:** [17.09.2024]

Weather Widget is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our app.

### Information Collection and Use

Weather Widget does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) from its users. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data based on the city entered by the user. The city information is processed locally on your device and is not sent to our servers.

Weather data entered by the user is retained locally on your device for up to two weeks. This data includes temperature, humidity, and weather conditions for tracking purposes. You may clear this data at any time by clearing your browser or application cache.

### Third-Party Services

Weather Widget uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. OpenWeatherMap may collect certain data related to API requests, such as IP addresses, to provide accurate weather information. Please refer to their privacy policy for further details: [OpenWeatherMap Privacy Policy](https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy).

### Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect the information processed by the app. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any updates to this policy will be posted here.
